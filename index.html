        <h1 class="head1">Synopsis</h1>
        <p class="con1">Léon is an Italian-American hitman (or "cleaner", as he refers to himself) working for a mafioso
            named "Old Tony" in the Little Italy neighborhood of New York City. One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando, a
            lonely twelve-year-old who lives with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hall from Léon and
            has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls.

            Mathilda's abusive father attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine
            in his apartment. After they discover that he has been stealing from their stash, DEA agents invade the
            apartment, led by their drug-addicted boss, Norman Stansfield. During their search for the missing drugs,
            Stansfield murders Mathilda's family while she is out shopping for groceries. When she returns, Mathilda
            realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall to Léon's apartment; he hesitantly gives
            her shelter.

            Mathilda quickly discovers that Léon is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his
            skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. At first, Léon is unsettled by her
            presence and considers killing her in her sleep, but he eventually trains Mathilda and shows her how to use
            various weapons. In exchange, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment, and teaches him how to read.
            Mathilda looks up to Léon and quickly develops a crush on him, often telling him she loves him, but he does
            not reciprocate.

            When Léon is out on a job, Mathilda fills a bag with guns from Léon's collection and sets out to kill
            Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl and is ambushed by
            Stansfield in a bathroom. One of his men arrives and informs him that Léon killed Malky, one of the corrupt
            DEA agents, in Chinatown that morning. Léon, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues
            Mathilda, killing two more of Stansfield's men in the process. An enraged Stansfield confronts Tony, who is
            roughed up and forced to disclose Léon's whereabouts.

            Léon tells Mathilda about how he became a hitman. When Léon was nineteen in Italy, he fell in love with a
            girl from a wealthy family, but Léon's family was poor. The two made plans to elope, but when the girl's
            father discovered them, he killed her out of anger. Léon killed the father in revenge and fled to New York,
            where he met Tony and trained to become a hitman.

            Later, while Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team sent by Stansfield captures her
            and infiltrates Léon's apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and rescues Mathilda. Léon creates a quick
            escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft. He tells her that he loves her and to meet him at
            Tony's place in an hour, moments before the ESU team fires a grenade into the apartment, wounding Léon and
            creating chaos. He manages to disguise himself as a wounded ESU officer and sneaks down through the
            staircase. He goes unnoticed by everyone except Stansfield, who follows him and shoots him in the back. As
            Léon dies, he presses a grenade pin in Stansfield's palm, saying that it is from Mathilda. Stansfield opens
            Léon's vest to find a cluster of grenades, which detonate, killing Stansfield.

            Mathilda goes to Tony and tries to convince him to hire her, but Tony flatly refuses to employ a
            twelve-year-old and tells Mathilda that Léon asked him to give his money to her if anything happened to him.
            Tony gives Mathilda $100 as an initial allowance and sends her back to school, where the headmistress
            re-admits her after Mathilda reveals what has happened. Mathilda walks onto a field near the school to plant
            Léon's houseplant, as she had told Léon, to "give it roots".</p>
